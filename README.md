## Description

#

Hobby Drop (Hd) is an app that gives the user the ability to find, search and post new hobbyâ€™s. The user will also be able to sell unwanted items from a hobby they are not interested in. This will also give the user the ability to find cheaper items on a new hobby they found on the site.

There will also be a login functionality that will take the user to a dedicated user page. In the page they will be able to see their favorite hobbies, items looking to be sold and trending hobbies that others are looking at.

Once logged in, they will be able to also search the home page where they will find a search bar for new hobbies, links and pictures to more information on hobbies and a promotional/newsletter page.
